# GridScheduler

This is a quick-and-dirty demonstration for an SVG-based scheduler.

Advantages of this approach:
* Can easily render a full year worth of events, with a cell for every hour of the year
* Scrolling without the need for JavaScript (Browser native scrolling)
* will never get out-of-sync between the headers, body and the events, because the whole scheduler is one single svg image

# Run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
